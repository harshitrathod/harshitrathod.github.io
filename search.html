        "content": "Why are you here?Recently, In every industry, everyone is talking about machine learning. In last few years, ML popularity increases exponentially.A graph shows the popularity of machine learning topic from 2004. As shown from 2012 to 2016 it increases by 400%. Every day hundreds of researcher publishing papers about how ML can be used in different domains. ML has a large number of use cases from simple sales prediction to complex medical image processing.1 year ago I started exploring ML and I found it is quite interesting. But learning ML concept is quite hard for beginners because of there is nothing right or wrong in ML. You can apply the same solution to every problem and it will give you some result. Difficulty increase when you need to get state of art result for a particular problem. You will find so many tutorials for machine learning algorithms but an understanding of the underlying mechanism is hard. The same problem happens to me also, When I work on the problem I can copy and paste the code from a different similar problem and get a good result. But when I need to improve this model I can only do one thing “Try and Try…”. And found this will not work 90% of the time. So I decided to revise all my understanding of ML deeply and document it. This post and following posts will have only one focus and That is “Deep understanding of the concept”. I will try to research and document methodology, concept, use case and result. Hope it Helps!!IntroductionConsider One architecture model which takes lots of data as input. With this data and some algorithms model with learn relationships and patterns within data. After this learning phase now if we ask this model some question by giving data it will try to match given data to relationships and pattern found during learning and gives an answer.Machine Learning is a field which tries to take above model and solve a different problem.With different problem Model + Data + Learning will change. The goal of machine learning is to get best model which can solve a problem efficiently and accurately.You can solve many problems with one model and different data. with different data, knowledge gain by learning will be different and hence output will be different for each problem. to understand this take an example of Bob, Bob doesn’t know how to cook pizza so Bob goes to recipe website and read about how to make pizza. After reading Bob acquired knowledge of making pizza and now Bob can make delicious pizza. After that bob decides to make pasta and again goes to a website and learn about it.Relate this example to machine learning concept. Bob is our model. make pizza is one problem. By reading a recipe which is our Data, Bob learns to make pizza. and an outcome is Bob can now make pizza. now change problem to make pasta and as we noticed only data is changed and with this data, acquired knowledge is different and result also changed but model(Bob) is still same. In my opinion flexibility like this is the main reason for ML popularity.Classification of machine learning problemWe can classify Machine learning problem based on output produce by model and what input model required. Based on this we can classify problem in two categories.  Supervised learning  Unsupervised learning1. Supervised learningIn Supervised learning we know which output we are looking for based on input data. In other words, there is a relationship between input and output. In terms of math, $ Y = F(x) $ is a simple equation for Supervised learning. Based on a type of $ F(x) $ we can divide Supervised learning problem into 2 category  Regression (where $ Y $ is a continuous function) :          In regression output of a model is continuous function means if we plot all values of Y we will get an unbroken line on a graph.      Eg. problem “Predict temperature of a city” comes under regression because of we plot all possible value of output, It will be a continuous line        Classification (where $ Y $ discrete function) :          In classification, we have only a few values of Y for each input. we can treat Y as a category which we are trying to map with each input      Eg. predict the type of car      2. Unsupervised learningIn Unsupervised learning, we do not have any idea about how our result looks like. We feed data and expect a model to give us relationships in data. Clustering is Unsupervised learning technique which used to find relationships and make cluster of thatConclusionML is fascinating subject with endless possibility. In this post, we covered basic terminology like a model type of ML problems. In Next post, I will go deep into model and math behind it.  Add a comment below if you have any doubt.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "Every developer needs to perform refactoring in his Professional career. You need Refactoring when you feel your code is not maintainable or scalable. With complex design some time is it very hard to develop a new feature and refactoring is essential. Refactoring is a very critical task because it can open a door for bugs.When I start refactoring, the first thing I do is analyze entire code end to end. I will not code utile I get a good understanding of impact. When I am going through the code I need a way to add comments to a line or method level. This is where IntelliJ TODO tool helps.What is IntelliJ TODO tool?It’s tool window where you can able to refer all comment which you mentioned in your Tool pattern setting. IntelliJ is continuous scanning project for this TODO pattern and when the pattern matches, display comment on tool window. By default, IntelliJ have two TODO pattern //TODO and //FixMe.  These matches any comment Starting with //TODO and //FixMeTo see all your TODO comments open TODO tool windows from View -&gt; Tool Windows -&gt; TODO or (Alt + 6)You have all your TODO Comment displayed over here. You have 3 option to limit your scope. It means if you select “Project” scope, scan happens on all project files. For more information, you can refer: TODO tool Window How to create Custom TODO pattern?You can define your own TODO pattern in IntelliJ.Once you add this pattern, IntelliJ scan for this pattern and display matching items in IntelliJ tool window.  Go to Setting -&gt; Editor -&gt; TODO for adding new patternAs you can see we have 2 default pattern already configured. Click on Plus Icon to add new PatternYou need to define Your pattern here. I have configured \\bhello\\b.* which will map all comment starting from hello. You can use Regular Expression Syntax Reference To define Your Pattern. You can also change the color scheme of comment also. After saving changes you can able to see all your comment starting with Hello in TODO tool WindowTODO comment with Refactoring :Now we know how to add TODO pattern we can use it in our refactoring. When I start Refactoring I have one JIRA Id for a task. I will create one TODO pattern with this Id. For example, I have 1245 as Jira Id so I create a pattern like \\b1245\\b.*.  After this, I will start my code analysis and when I need to add some points I will add a comment with 1245 in a prefix. Now I can see all comments in TODO tool window.In a large project, It is possible that you have so many TODO comments. Finding particular comment will become a pain in such situations. You can create your TODO filter so that Only specific comments will be filtered.Create TODO Filter:Go to Setting -&gt; Editor -&gt; TODO and click plus to add a filter.Select Pattern which will be included in this filter and save changes. Now on TODO tool window open filter menu. Select Your filter and your all comment will be filtered by selected pattern.Now I have all my comment filtered, I can work on my code to resolve it. Now It’s easy to go to impacted code through TODO tool. I also can track how much work is pending by a number of comments in TODO tool window.When I am done with refactoring and committing my code, I can select  “Check TODO” options in my “Before Commit” section. What it will do is scan all files and check if any TODO item is pending or not. You can also apply a filter to scan particular pattern.Conclusion:I developed this technique over the time while working on many refactoring tasks. This is like creating my refactoring checklist which tracks my progress. By doing this systematically we can reduce the probability of bugs.I am happy to have some feedback to improve this technique further!",

        "content": "It’s been almost 2 years since my Professional career started. In these years, I always have some struggle to decide stable development setup which works for me. I went through many blogs to decide stable setup but didn’t work for me. The main reason for this is my custom workflow. I have my preferences which may not work for others. This post will give some clarification of tools which are on my laptop.Operating System (OS)There is no doubt about OS which is currently on my laptop. It’s Linux. Linux will never disappoint any developer. I started programming on the windows machine. With time when stuff gets complex and windows didn’t sustain. I was spending more time to solve windows problem rather than my actual problem. The amount of my productivity eaten by windows machine is so high that I finally decided to format my laptop and Installed LinuxOne can argue about which flavor is better than other. One can choose CentOs over Ubuntu or Fedora on their preference. I used Ubuntu only and since then didn’t face any situation to change. The biggest benefit of Ubuntu is their support. There is a huge community out there to support any of your system problems.BrowserThere are two browsers on my laptop, Chromium and Firefox. I am using Chromium because of the interface which I am using for many years. I know most of the shortcut keys on Chromium which increase my productivity. Chrome web store has many good plugins which I am using for a long time. I only open Firefox to test UI because the project on which I am working support these two browsers. Pinned tab vs BookmarksI have many websites which are used frequently in my day to day life. I prefer to have pinned tab over bookmarks because  You can access these sites by chrome tab shortcut keys ( Ctrl + ‘tab number’ ) rather than opening it from bookmarks  If there is any notification, you can see from tab header. In bookmarks, you can’t know about notification until opening itI have following websites in my tab list  LinkedIn  Twitter  Gmail  Evernote  Stack overflow  Google Calander  WordPress Dashboard of this siteTerminalTerminatorFirst thing I do when I start my laptop is open terminal. I have a habit of opening any tool from command line even though it is in my sidebar. I use Terminator instead of default terminal. The main reason to use Terminator is you can open many terminals in one window. Also, it is providing many shortcuts to switch between tabs. Most of the time I am on terminal debugging server by logs. By having many terminals I can run the command in one and watch for logs in other.Oh My ZSH!Sometimes it is frustrating to write entire command to default bash. This open source project will provide you many functions and plugin which you can use to increase your productivity. As far as I know, this contains aliases and wrapper function of all command which I use in day to day life. If you don’t find command in this you can also create your own aliases and function. Next time onward rather than typing entire command you can call aliases or a function.  You can install ZSH by following this steps  List of ZSH plugins          I am using following plugins      plugins=(git history mvn lol last-working-dir jira common-aliases vagrant zsh-autosuggestions)        Enable ZSH in your TerminatorMy Custom Aliases:# Git Push current branch and create remote branchalias gpn='git push -u origin $(git branch | grep \\* | cut -d '\\'' '\\'' -f2)'#Force push current branchalias gpf='git push -f origin $(git branch | grep \\* | cut -d '\\'' '\\'' -f2)'# Git push current branchalias gpc='git push origin $(git branch | grep \\* | cut -d '\\'' '\\'' -f2)'I am using this extra 3 aliases for Git. By doing this I did not need to write entire command again and again. Please refer this to set aliases in zshVagrant2 years ago when I needed to install Oracle and MySQL on my laptop. It took me 2 days to just install this two stuff. After doing all this I found out that I installed an older version of MySQL. While removing MySQL, I had done something wrong that I am not able to install new MySQL. This should not be acceptable. Then I spend the entire weekend to find the alternative solution to this problem. I need a solution that is quick and doesn’t screw my laptop. This is How I found Vagrant. It took only 2 hours to install both databases on my laptop. with vagrant, I can remove or add stuff without changing anything on my Host machine.IntelliJIDE is a weapon to any developer without it, you can not survive. One can write a simple program in notepad without IDE but when we talk about large-scale application, IDE is key for fast delivery. When someone solving a bug or adding new feature in project having hundreds of files, One can not succeed with simple notepadFrom last 2 years, I am using IntelliJ IDEA. I am so happy with it that I didn’t try any other IDE. I don’t have a comparison of IDEA with other IDE but after using it so long I know shortcuts for all the action which frequently occur in developer’s life. I can code in many languages without changing IDE every time. I have modified default setting according to my need which I will share in a future post.With this post, I tried to share my experience and difficulty which I faced while coding. I also tried to find a solution to these problems. Something might be done differently to get a better result and I am happy to try new things.",

        "content": "  Summary  The Postman is a feature rich REST client. Thousands of developers used it to browse, test and even documenting APIs. This post aims to provide basic information you need to start using PostmanIntroductionStarted in 2012 with the idea of REST client Postman has improved itself to support all the feature you need for API development and testing. According to officials in 2014, it has 3+ million active users. You can make HTTP requests like GET,  POST,  PUT,  DELETE from it. You can also perform automation test on your API using it. With monitoring feature, you can execute set of requests to check for its performance and responseIt’s available as a Chrome extension and native app build on The Electron. I recommended using the native app because Chrome extension will be deprecated soon.  You can download it from here. In this post, we will use service call Postman Echo to mock our API Send your first requestCalling API from Postman is like a cakewalk. For simplicity, we will do a GET request to the server  URL of API  Request Type [GET, POST, PUT, DELETE]  Send button To call the API  Response Of API  More information  History of past API callsSend Post data with Request:While doing a POST request to the API you need to pass some data as a body. As given in the screenshot above, you can pass data while calling your APICollectionsPostman provides good way to Organize your related request. It’s called Collections. It’s like folder structure so you can browse API. Also You can use collections with Test script but this will be explained later. You can create and browse Collection as displayed below                Click New Button to Add Collection                    Provide Collection name and detail and then save Collection                    Click On save button to add a request to the Collection                    Add detail and select collection                    Form collection tab you can access your Collections    ExampleWhen you have different frontend and backend team, REST API design is the most important part.  Frontend team doesn’t want to refactor their code because of misunderstanding about API design. Postman solves this problem with the concept called “Example”. You can save request/response parameter of your API as an Example. After saving your Example, You can share it with the team. You can also create a mock server with Postman mock server. frontend team can use it as an alternative to actual API                Click on Add Example                    Add request and response detail                    Access Example    ConclusionPostman is a day to day tool for any developer.  Any backend developer can quickly check his API without any frontend application. Also, the developer can write test script which will help them to do impact analysis of their change on API. Frontend developer can use this as an alternative to actual API which will make them independent of backend team  ",
